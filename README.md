# MapNotify
Notifications about map mods, quantity, packsize and other useful information for immediate parsing

Also covers Heists, Watchstones and Maven Invitations, including instantly displaying which monsters you have killed for the uncharted realms series.

Holding alt over an elder guardian map will also display that information.

Primarily targetted at TehCheat's non-public HUD but should work on Queuete's as long as the offsets are up to date as it uses no esoteric features.
